Hello world!

Coriander is a GUI for controlling a Digital Camera (compatible with
the IIDC specs issued by the 1394 Trade Association [1]). Coriander
offers full camera control (including Format_7 and absolute settings),
live video display, images and streams saving, images posting with FTP
and last but not least video4linux (V4L) export. The latter service
allows you to use Coriander as a V4L video generator for popular
applications like GnomeMeeting, Effectv,... Due to the properties of
the IEEE1394 protocol, Coriander can even control an IEEE1394 camera
without interferring with the image flow from that camera. You can
thus setup a camera with Coriander while the video flow is used by
another application.

				**********

IMPORTANT NOTE: Coriander will NOT work with consumer-grade DV cameras
(e.g. cameras in which you can insert a tape). These cameras should be
controlled with he AV/C protocol, please refer to [8]. Also, not all
industrial cameras are IIDC specs-compliant. Check [7] to have a list
of currently supported cameras.

				**********

Most image processing scientists using 1394 cameras under Linux know
about the libdc1394 library [2]. However, it's a real problem when you
need to quickly setup a demo or get some frames for testing. If, just
like me, you also had this problem, Coriander is for you [4]!

Please have a look at the TODO, ChangeLog and BUGS files to see the
current status of the project. Contributors are most welcome so if
you're interrested in making this program better don't hesitate to
contact me.

The latest version can be found on the SourceForge website:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/coriander

There is a user manual available at the same URL. Please read it
before sending tons-o-emails to me!! ;-) You will also get a faster
reply if you send your e;ails to the mailing lists (see above).

As I can only test Coriander with the cameras I have which means some
features have not been tested. If you have another camera, please test
Coriander and send to the mailing list with the bugs you identified.

Last but not least, Coriander has received vision hardware donations or
lease and technical help from the following companies:

- Hamamatsu Photonics http://www.hpk.co.jp
- The Imaging Source  http://www.1394imaging.com
- Point Grey Research http://www.ptgrey.com
- Basler GmbH         http://www.balserweb.com
- Dage-MTI	      http://www.dagemti.com

Many thanks for their support!

Damien


Install instructions:
_______________________

Basically, you should just type:

./configure
make
make install

If you got a CVS version you need to type

./autogen.sh
make
make install

If you have troubles, please read the INSTALL file provided.



Hardware requirements:
_______________________

- A linux box,
- an 1394 interface card (PCI, CardBus, whatever...). Try to get an
  OHCI card as their support is better under Linux.
- a digital camera compatible with IIDC specs v1.04 or later.



Software requirements:
_______________________

Software requirements are now more or less correctly probed by the configure
script: libdc1394, libraw1394, MMX/SSE capabilities, libftp and SDL libs are
checked.

- a kernel with 1394 support [3], preferably a recent 2.6.X
  Kernel modules to be compiled: ieee1394, ohci1394, raw1394 and video1394
- XFree 3.3.6 (XFree 4.1.0 recommended for video overlay)
- Gtk 1.2 & Gtk-devel
- libraw1394 [5] and libdc1394 [2] installed. You need at least libdc1394
  2.0.0.
- ftplib installed for FTP support [9]
- SDL installed for display support [11]
- Glade (for development only)
- automake 1.4 (for development only)
- autoconf 2.13 (for development only)
- vloopback module v 0.92 for v4l support [12]. You should apply the patch
  found in the nice effectv program [13] the 0.90 version in order to have
  it working. Effectv can be used to check that v4l is working. Note that
  if you use videoN as v4l device in Coriander, the device other applications
  can use is video(N+1). V4l service works also well with Gnomemeeting [14].
  vloopback will only work with kernels 2.6 if you use the latest patch.

In order to have Xv support within SDL, you will maybe need some custom
drivers, e.g. for Nvidia chipsets [10] or for ATI Rage chipsets [6].

Debian-based distribution packages:
If you are using a Debian-based distribution, you can easily choose to
install the following packages that will allow you to compile the code:
libgnome-dev libgnomeui-dev libxv-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev
